# Anemia Analysis in Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women

## Overview
This project analyzes anemia prevalence in women, focusing on differences between pregnant and non-pregnant groups using WHO data from 2000 to 2019. It explores hemoglobin distribution, diagnostic challenges, and regional variations, aiming to improve understanding and intervention strategies.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Processed and organized using pandas.
- **Visualizations:** Created histograms, box plots, and heatmaps with matplotlib and seaborn to illustrate hemoglobin levels and regional prevalence.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Applied logistic regression to classify anemia status and evaluated accuracy using a confusion matrix.
- **Trend Analysis:** Used linear regression to study anemia trends over time across different regions.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Key Findings
- **Regional Differences:** South-East Asia and Africa have the highest anemia rates, especially among pregnant women, while the Americas show the lowest rates.
- **Diagnostic Challenges:** Overlapping hemoglobin levels between anemic and non-anemic groups suggest the need for more nuanced diagnostic criteria.
- **Public Health Implications:** The study underscores the necessity for targeted interventions in high-risk regions and ongoing monitoring to adapt public health strategies effectively.
